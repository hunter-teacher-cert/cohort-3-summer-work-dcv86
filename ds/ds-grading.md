#### Competency Grading Matrix for CSCI70300 (Data Structures)

# Levels
- Basic
- Intermediate
- Advanced
- Challenge (Not counted in grade)
- Required (treated as a pass/fail - required but no grade awarded)

An A grade can be earned by completing the level indicated on a
particular assignment. Challenge level assignments are included for
groups that complete all the required work so that they can stretch themselves and 
are not counted in the final grades.


# Concepts
- ArrayLists
- Pointers
- Linked Lists
- Sorting 
- Tress
- Hashing


*Note:* Grade level in the table refers to the grade level exhibited
by completing the specific assignment, so, for instance if you
finished Nim, you would be assured a B type grade which could be a B,
B- or B+ on loops for completing Nim.  However, if you complete another assignment that awards a higher grade for loops, then the higher grade will replace the grade awarded by Nim. Also note that for Arrays2D, the grades earned are more specific, with + and - specified.
