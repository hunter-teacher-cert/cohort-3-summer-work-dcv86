#### written with collaborative input from Team hashtagBEGUDFAM
Roster: Dave, David, Vanessa, Ben

### Environment
* school size: 750
* school grade range: 6-12
* faculty count: 0.5 (me)
* courses: 6th Robotics, 7th Grade Digital Literacy, 8th Grade CS Discoveries, HS Intro to CS, AP Computer Science Princples.

### CS / Makers Club: Computer Science

#### Expected Positive Outcomes
* This is attractive because it will give students who are curious about CS a chance to code in a group setting with more experienced student programmers leading the group in work.

#### Rollout Timeline
* I'd say about a month to roll-out. Space is always at a premium at my school, so finding a time / place for the club to meet will be the most challenging. 

#### Mechanism for Gauging Efficacy
* Personally, if the studnts are engaged in any form of CS learning.
* If they complete a project, all the better. But just as long as their working on CS

#### Expected Hurdles and Plans to Overcome
* ( if any... )
