# 09_Colab Lesson (Dave Ciolino-Volano)
1. Assignment: We will use the debug lesson for this example.
2. Groupwork approach: Students will use the driver-navagator for the assignment.
3. The benefit of this groupwork model allows studnts who are struggling to gain assistance from a studnet who his stronger; inversely, stronger students get to practice explaining the work, thus solidifying their knowledge.
4. Circulating through-out the class and observing working dynamics in groups as well as questining is a good way to asses the work is going.
5. That's the $64,000 question... I'd say the best way is to reserve the right to adjust groups on the fly. Or add / remove members.
6. Having posters of driver/navagator model, practicing it, and keeping instructions up on the board while the assignment is going on.
7. Long-term... this allows students to interact with a variety of skill levels.
