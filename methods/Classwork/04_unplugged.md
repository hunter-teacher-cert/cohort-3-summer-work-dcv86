# SORTING ALGORITHM CREATION

### Background
Two activities:
* Line up by height order (Do Now)
* Snippets of code to make it.

Could be great gateway into sorting after learning some ideas about arrays and searching algorithms.  Give them various code snippets to make the algorithm; then we test. 

### Participant pre-requisites
Would need to know: for loops, while loops, conditionals, return/void methods, dot(.)method (length, size, get, set), list types, searching algorithm.

### Scaffolding / Differentiation 
* an aspect of this activity well-suited to tiering / scaffolding / differentiation.
  * may give some groups bits and pieces starting point to end point.
  * Color code code snippets (ex: conditionals-yellow, loops-green, return-red, etc.)
* a grouping suggestion
* prefacing verbiage to share with participants ahead of time...
* etc.

### Go!
1. Do Now (Size Ordering)
    - Have 10 volunteers to be data (of different heights) and stand in random order.
    - Have remaining students figure out how to sort them in height order from the first to last person (short -> tall)
1. Explain that they will use their code snippets to make an algorithm to sort an array in Java.
1. Students work in small groups(2-3) to create their algorithm.
1. Test the algorithms as a class or possibly in exit slip in trace diagram.
    - Test their algorithms with the initial students--whose is fastest?  Faster than Do Now?  Lots of chances to test and verify working code.üëç.
