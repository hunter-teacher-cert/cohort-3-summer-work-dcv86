# Technique 1: Use of cheat sheet (poster, google doc, )

### Well-suited to...
- All assignments - helps students get started when they understand the assignment but forgot the code or syntax.
- Quick reference for students 


### Example:
#### Loops:
- for (int i = 0, i (insert comparison), change){}
- while (condition is true){}
- new Class with its methods as a reference
- 

name of a coding activity (like BinarySearch, For loops, etc)
name of a not-necessarily coding activity
code snippet to illustrate
etc

# Technique 2: Diagramming (Trace/Stack/etc)

### Well-suited to...
- Code where there are multiple variable or variables that change throughout the program 
- Planning before coding
  * Helps understand a process
  * visualizer
  * good for team work

### Example:
#### Loops with sum/count variable:
- for (int i = 0, i (insert comparison), change){}
- Trace what the value of the variable will be after each iteration
#### Recursion:
- tracking each iteration of a recursive sequence (like Fibonacci) and then visualizing how it returns to the main.
